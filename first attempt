        So, I'm just going to start with a bit of background.
At the time I'm writing this, I am 57 years old, with the big 58 looming large in about a month and a half. I have some medical issues: HIV, Bipolar Disorder, a bunch of shit going on with my lower back, and something called Sensory Perception Sensitivity (more on that later.)
I've had one major (“widowmaker”) heart attack and 2 surgeries, ACDF on my neck and a total hip replacement on my right side. 
I live at my paren’s home most of the time. I know, Iknow. You’re saying to yourself, “Why the fuck is a 57 year old man still living at home?!?!” Well, it’s because I just don’t do well on my own. I tend to forget things, like paying bills, taking meds, etc. Also, I’m on SSI disabilty and my $804 and my $114 in SNAP benefits each month is not enough to live on even if I was in some sort of income based housing,  I spend part of my time in Atlanta living at my sister Dana’s place. Each place has it’s pros and cons.
I also have some other “issues.” I still smoke cigarettes.And I smoke meth. Yes, that’s right,I smoke meth. Not every day and not in large quantities. I suppose my addiction has sort of morphed into something that leaves me mostly functional. I also do G (GHB for those of you not in the illicit drug world.) The combination is an excellent buzz.
